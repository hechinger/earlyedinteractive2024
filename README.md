//Code for the scrolly. 
//READ ME: Try the code out in preview mode. But, Preview mode isn't always a guarantee. If it's not working once published, remove the code from the story. 
// TROUBLE SHOOT: Check for typos or missing symbols like < >. For example, it's important that there's a carrot before and after style so it's always <style>, and same goes for the script section at the end. Make sure nothing got cut off at the beginning or end: for example, the last thing in the code should be </script>. The </XXX> tells the code that a chunk is over.
// If it's still not working... alert Marina or whoever knows coding on staff. 
// ALSO: We can use this same basic framework for scrollies in other stories. 
//  To start, copy and paste the below code and put it into an editor like TextEdit. 
// To start tweaking it to suit your purposes with your own text and images...
// HOW TO CHANGE IMAGES: Go to line 84, where you'll see this: <div class="step" data-img="url('https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/df-file1.png')">
//  That's where the first background image for the scrolly lives. 
// To make your own scrolly with other images... upload the graphics to our Wordpress, and then copy and paste the URL of those graphics into this part of the code. 
// HOW TO CHANGE TEXT: Go to line 85, where you'll see this:  <p class="articleInner">Other documents describe staff failing to comfort crying injured children, and letting young children play on unsafe gym equipment.</p>
// That's where the text goes. To keep making your new scrolly, delete old text and add new text in each chunk. 
// FURTHER CHANGES: If you want to change how the scrolly looks, including the font etc, make adjustments in the code that's inside the <style> section which starts on Line 13 and ends on Line 72.
// If you want to change how the scrolly scrolls, make adjustments in the last section, which is the script section that starts on line 97.
